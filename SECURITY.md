# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for the security issue.

Instead, we kindly request you to report it via email to mikhail.yarmaliuk@lomray.com. This allows us to assess the risk and coordinate the fix before the vulnerability becomes public knowledge.

When reporting security issues, please provide the following information:

 - Description of the issue
 - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
 - Your contact information

We take all security reports seriously and will do our best to rapidly address the issue. We are grateful for your contributions to our security efforts, and we will acknowledge your report upon resolution.

## Responsible Disclosure
We adhere to the principle of responsible disclosure. This means that if you discover a vulnerability, you agree to:

 - Not disclose the issue publicly until we have had sufficient time to address it.
 - Not exploit the issue for any malicious purpose.
 - Not access or modify data without explicit permission from the owner.
We commit to handling your report with strict confidentiality and will keep you informed of the progress toward resolving the issue.

Thank you for helping us ensure the security and privacy.
